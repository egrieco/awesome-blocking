# BlockList Repos

An [awesome repository](https://github.com/sindresorhus/awesome) to collect various resources related to ad, tracker, and other malicious resource blocking.

## Git Blocklist Repos

Git repos are preferred because they can be cloned and used completely offline. They can be transferred to new owner ship, forked to focus on new concerns and cloned via distributed protocols or even sneaker net.

## URL Blocking Resources

These resources are served by conventional URLs and thus have not history. They will also be harder to transfer to a new maintainer if the original maintainer moves on.
